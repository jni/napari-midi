Control napari with a USB MIDI controller

----------------------------------

## What works

- bidirectional updates of the button and rotary dial LEDs
- Fast and slow scrolling dials
- Opacity of the topmost layer with the slider
- All out-of-tree code: no hacking napari internals needed ðŸŽ‰
- Pretty decent API I think...! See all the `.bind_` calls at the end of the file.

## What doesn't work

- Any kind of documentation or comments ðŸ˜‚
- Thread safety â€” see #2326 for how to do it properly, I mistakenly thought that our events would handle that for us ðŸ˜¬, thanks @tlambert03 for clarifying that the most certainly do not! ðŸ˜‚
- (same vein) race conditions. Some of our events don't seem to carry the event data (?), and checking the source for the value sometimes returns the old value â€” hence the `time.sleep` currently there.
- super clunky implementation
